# **Smalles multiple**
## Problem:
2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 
to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the 
numbers from 1 to 20?

## Answer:
232792560

## My Solution:

***Make a product of the largest multiples(<20) of each prime(<20)***
- 2  => 20
- 3  => 18
- 5  => 20 (duplicated)
- 7  => 14
- 11 => 11
- 13 => 13
- 17 => 17
- 19 => 19

So 11x13x17x19x14x18x20 = 232792560

I don't think you need to use computer to solve that question
