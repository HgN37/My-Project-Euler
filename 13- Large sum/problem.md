# **Large sum**
## Problem:
Work out the first ten digits of the sum of the following one-hundred 50-digit numbers.

(numbers are stored in *number.txt*)

## Answer:
5537376230

## My solution:
***Elementary sum method***

Canculate each digit of the sum, from LSB to MSB.

*Ex*: 56 + 17
- 6 plus 7 equal 3 remember 1.
- 5 plus 1 equal 6, 6 add 1 equal 7.
- 56 + 17 = 73

Do the same with 100 50-digit numbers, you will find every digit of the sum.
