# __Highly divisible triangular number__ 
## Problem:
The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be:

1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:

- 1: 1
- 3: 1,3
- 6: 1,2,3,6
- 10: 1,2,5,10
- 15: 1,3,5,15
- 21: 1,3,7,21
- 28: 1,2,4,7,14,28
We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.

What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?

## Answer:
76576500

## My solution:
*** Use the below formula ***

If a number X = a1^b1 + a2^b2 + a3 ^b3 + ... (which a1, a2, a3 is the number's prime factors). The number of divisors is (a1+1)x(a2+1)x(a3+1)x...

So the first thing to make is a prime table, 2000 first prime is enought for this problem.

*** Brute force ***

You can also try brute force to see how long it take. My laptop need half an hour to find the answer.
