__Problem 1: Multiples of 3 and 5
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
__Answer: 233168
__Solution:
+ The number we need to be summed up is 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18,...
+ The gap between each number is table = {3, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3} periodly.
+ while(currentNumber<100)
+ currentNumber += table[periodicIndex]
+ finalSum += currentNumber
