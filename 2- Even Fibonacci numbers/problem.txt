__Problem 2: Even Fibonacci numbers
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms.
By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million,
find the sum of the even-valued terms.

__Answer: 4613732

__Solution:
+ From number 2, an even number appear every 3 terms.
+ Just canculate that number and get the sum.
