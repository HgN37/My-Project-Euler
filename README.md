# __My-Project-Euler__
My solutions to [__Project Euler__](https://projecteuler.net/)'s problems.

In each folder is the solution of a problem. I will solve them one by one, about 1 problem each 2 days. The problem's detail, it's answer and my solution in *problem.md*. Now I can only use C, C++ and Python. I have no intention of using one sole language, so I will pick my most convinient one for each problem.

Hope you can help me improve my algorithm. And... sorry for my bad English.
