# __Summation of primes__

## Problem:
The sum of the primes below 10 is 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17. Find the sum of all the primes below two million.

## Answer: 
142913828922

## My Solution: 
__*Use isPrime() func in problem 7. Check and sum it up.*__

I don't think the The sieve of Eratosthenes, with need an array with a size of limit/2 is a better idea.
