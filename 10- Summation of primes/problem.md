# Summation of primes 

__Peoblem__:
The sum of the primes below 10 is 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17. Find the sum of all the primes below two million.

__Answer__: 142913828922

__My Solution__: Use isPrime func in problem 7. Check and sum it up.
I don't think the The sieve of Eratosthenes, with need an array with a size of limit/2 is a better idea.
